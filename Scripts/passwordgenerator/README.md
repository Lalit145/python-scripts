## About -

i have created a password generator file in python which is capable of geneating very hard password. It takes a hacking machine more than hexatrillion years to crack passwords generated by my python code.

## Customization -

One can change the length of the password, can include or exclude the symbols and uppercase letters by changing the size and boolean expression in 25th line of my code.
